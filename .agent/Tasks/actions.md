3. Actions organized into incomplete and completed sections
4. User sees clear count of pending vs completed tasks

### Completing Actions

## Feature Requirements

### Actions Checklist Display
- Two organized sections: Incomplete and Completed
- Section headers show count (e.g., "Incomplete Actions (3)")

### CRUD Operations

## Edge Cases

### No Actions for Lead
- Shows "No actions found" message
- Explains that actions are AI-generated from calls
- Other page sections still functional
- User can view communications and lead info

### All Actions Completed

- Completed section shows all items
- Provides sense of accomplishment
- User can uncheck if needed

### API Failure During Toggle
- Checkbox reverts to original state
- Error message shown to user
- Data consistency maintained
- User can retry operation

### Concurrent Action Updates
- Two users update same action simultaneously
- Last write wins (eventual consistency)
- No data corruption
- Refresh shows final state

### Long Action Text
- Text wraps properly within container
- No overflow or truncation
- Edit mode handles long text
- Maintains readability

### Missing Lead ID
- System validates lead_id parameter
- Redirects to New Leads if invalid
- Clear error message
- No broken page state

### Business Context Mismatch
- Action belongs to different business
- System validates business_id
- Access denied if mismatch
- Prevents cross-business data access

### Rapid Toggle Operations
- User quickly checks/unchecks multiple actions
- System queues operations
- All updates processed correctly
- UI remains responsive

### Network Timeout
- Long API delay during update
